# TB-Doktorhut

This is the code powering @bingmann's graduation hat. It runs on an ESP32 and displays live exchange rates (EUR/USD and GBP/USD) on an SSD1306 128x64 pixel display. Additionally, it visualises quicksort on an SK6812B RGWB LED strip of length 41.

It was coded in a hurry and that shows. Please don't look at the code.
